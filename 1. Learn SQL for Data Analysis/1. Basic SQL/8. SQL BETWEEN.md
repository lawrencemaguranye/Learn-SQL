## SQL BETWEEN

**In this lesson we'll cover:**
- The SQL BETWEEN operator
- Practice problem

### The SQL BETWEEN operator

`BETWEEN` is a **logical operator** in SQL that allows you to select only rows that are within a specific range. It has to be paired with the `AND` operator, which you'll learn about in a later lesson. Here's what `BETWEEN` looks like on a **Billboard Music Chart Dataset**:

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM tutorial.billboard_top_100_year_end
 WHERE year_rank BETWEEN 5 AND 10
```

#### Take Note:

This SQL query selects all columns from the `billboard_top_100_year_end` table in the `tutorial` database where the `year_rank` column is between 5 and 10 (inclusive).

The `SELECT *` statement selects all columns from the table. The `FROM` clause specifies the table to select data from. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include rows where the `year_rank` column is between 5 and 10.

`BETWEEN` includes the range bounds (in this case, 5 and 10) that you specify in the query, in addition to the values between them. So the above query will return the exact same results as the following query:

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM tutorial.billboard_top_100_year_end
 WHERE year_rank >= 5 AND year_rank <= 10
```

### Practice Problem

Write a query that shows all top 100 songs from January 1, 1985 through December 31, 1990.

#### Solution

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM tutorial.billboard_top_100_year_end
 WHERE year BETWEEN 1985 AND 1990
```
