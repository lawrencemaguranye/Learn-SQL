## SQL IS NULL

**In this lesson I'll cover:**
- The `IS NULL` operator
- Practice problem

### The IS NULL operator

`IS NULL` is a logical operator in SQL that allows you to exclude rows with missing data from your results.

Some tables contain null values — cells with no data in them at all. This can be confusing for heavy Excel users, because the difference between a cell having no data and a cell containing a space isn't meaningful in Excel. In SQL, the implications can be pretty serious. This is covered in greater detail in the **intermediate tutorial**, but for now, here's what you need to know:

You can select rows that contain no data in a given column by using IS NULL. Let's try it out using a **dataset from the Billboard Music Charts**.

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM tutorial.billboard_top_100_year_end
 WHERE artist IS NULL
```

`WHERE artist = NULL` will not work—you can't perform arithmetic on null values.

### Practice Problem

Write a query that shows all of the rows for which `song_name` is null.

#### Solution

```sql
SELECT *
    FROM tutorial.billboard_top_100_year_end
WHERE song_name IS NULL
```
