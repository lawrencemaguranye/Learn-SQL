## SQL LIKE

**In this lesson I'll cover:**
- The SQL LIKE operator
- Wildcards and ILIKE
- Practice problems

### The SQL LIKE operator

`LIKE` is a **logical operator** in SQL that allows you to match on similar values rather than exact ones.

In this example, the results from the **Billboard Music Charts dataset** will include rows for which `"group"` starts with "Snoop" and is followed by any number and selection of characters.

Run the code to see which results are returned.

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM tutorial.billboard_top_100_year_end
 WHERE group_name LIKE 'Snoop%'
```

### Wildcards and ILIKE

The `%` used above represents any character or set of characters. In this case, `%` is referred to as a "wildcard." In the type of SQL that Mode uses, `LIKE` is case-sensitive, meaning that the above query will only capture matches that start with a capital "S" and lower-case "noop." To ignore case when you're matching values, you can use the `ILIKE` command:

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM tutorial.billboard_top_100_year_end
 WHERE "group" ILIKE 'snoop%'
```

You can also use `_` (a single underscore) to substitute for an individual character:

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM tutorial.billboard_top_100_year_end
 WHERE artist ILIKE 'dr_ke'
```

### Practice Problems

#### Solution

1. Write a query that returns all rows for which Ludacris was a member of the group.

#### Solution

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM tutorial.billboard_top_100_year_end
 WHERE group_name ILIKE 'ludacr%'
```
**OR**

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM tutorial.billboard_top_100_year_end
 WHERE group_name LIKE 'Ludacr%'
```

2. Write a query that returns all rows for which the first artist listed in the group has a name that begins with "DJ".

#### Solution

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM tutorial.billboard_top_100_year_end
 WHERE group_name LIKE 'DJ%'
```
