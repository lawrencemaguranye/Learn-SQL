## SQL LIMIT

**In this lesson I'll cover:**
- Why should you limit your results?
- Using the **SQL LIMIT** command

### Why should you limit your results?

Many analysts use ```LIMIT``` as a simple way to keep their queries from taking too long to return. The aim of many of your queries will be to see what a particular table looks like - you'll want to scan the first few rows of data to get an idea of which fields you care about and how you want to manipulate them. If you query a very large table (such as one with hundreds of thousands or millions of rows) and don't use a limit, you could end up waiting a long time for all of your results to be displayed, which doesn't make sense if you only care about the first few.

### Using the SQL LIMIT command

The limiting functionality is built into most SQL Database Management Systems to prevent you from accidentally returning millions of rows without meaning. Syntax:

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM tutorial.us_housing_units
 LIMIT 100
 ```
