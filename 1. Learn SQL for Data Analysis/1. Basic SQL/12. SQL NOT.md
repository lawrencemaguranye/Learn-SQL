## SQL NOT

**In this lesson I'll cover:**
- The SQL `NOT` operator
- Practice problem

`NOT` is a **logical operator** in SQL that you can put before any conditional statement to select rows for which that statement is false.

Here's what NOT looks like in action in a query of **Billboard Music Charts data**:

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM tutorial.billboard_top_100_year_end
 WHERE year = 2013
   AND year_rank NOT BETWEEN 2 AND 3
```

In the above case, you can see that results for which `year_rank` is equal to 2 or 3 are not included.

Using `NOT` with `<` and `>` usually doesn't make sense because you can simply use the opposite comparative operator instead. For example, this query will return an error:

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM tutorial.billboard_top_100_year_end
 WHERE year = 2013
   AND year_rank NOT > 3
```

Instead, you would just write that as:

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM tutorial.billboard_top_100_year_end
 WHERE year = 2013
   AND year_rank <= 3
```

`NOT` is commonly used with `LIKE`. Run this query and check out how Macklemore magically disappears!

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM tutorial.billboard_top_100_year_end
 WHERE year = 2013
   AND group_name NOT ILIKE '%macklemore%'
```

`NOT` is also frequently used to identify non-null rows, but the syntax is somewhat special â€” you need to include IS beforehand. Here's how that looks:

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM tutorial.billboard_top_100_year_end
 WHERE year = 2013
   AND artist IS NOT NULL
```

### Practice Problem

Write a query that returns all rows for songs that were on the charts in 2013 and do not contain the letter "a".

#### Solution 

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM tutorial.billboard_top_100_year_end
 WHERE year = 2013
   AND song_name NOT ILIKE '%a%'
```
