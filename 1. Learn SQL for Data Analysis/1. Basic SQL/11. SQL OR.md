## SQL OR

**In this lesson I'll cover:**
- The SQL `OR` operator
- Practice problems

### The SQL OR operator

`OR` is a **logical operator** in SQL that allows you to select rows that satisfy either of two conditions. It works the same way as `AND`, which selects the rows that satisfy both of two conditions. Try OR out by running this query against **data from the Billboard Music Charts:**

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM tutorial.billboard_top_100_year_end
 WHERE year_rank = 5 OR artist = 'Gotye'
```

You'll notice that each row will satisfy one of the two conditions. You can combine AND with `OR` using parenthesis. The following query will return rows that satisfy **both** of the following conditions:

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM tutorial.billboard_top_100_year_end
 WHERE year = 2013
   AND (group_name ILIKE '%macklemore%' OR group_name ILIKE '%timberlake%')
```

- Rows where `year = 2013` is true and `group_name ILIKE '%macklemore%'` is true
- Rows where `year = 2013` is true and `group_name ILIKE '%timberlake%'` is true
- Rows where `year = 2013` is true and `group_name ILIKE '%macklemore%'` is true and `group_name ILIKE '%timberlake%'` is true

### Practice Problems

1. Write a query that returns all rows for top-10 songs that featured either Katy Perry or Bon Jovi.

#### Solution

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM tutorial.billboard_top_100_year_end
 WHERE year_rank <= 10
   AND (group_name ILIKE '%katy perry%' OR group_name ILIKE '%bon jovi%')
```

2. Write a query that returns all songs with titles that contain the word "California" in either the 1970s or 1990s.

#### Solution 

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM tutorial.billboard_top_100_year_end
 WHERE (year BETWEEN 1970 AND 1979 OR year BETWEEN 1990 AND 1999)
   AND song_name ILIKE '%california%'
```

3. Write a query that lists all top-100 recordings that feature Dr. Dre before 2001 or after 2009.

#### Solution

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM tutorial.billboard_top_100_year_end
 WHERE group_name ILIKE '%dr. dre%'
 AND (year <= 2000 OR year >= 2010)
```
