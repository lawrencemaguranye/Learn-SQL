## SQL AND 

In this lesson I'll cover:
- The SQL `AND` operator
- Practice problems

### The SQL AND operator

`AND` is a **logical operator** in SQL that allows you to select only rows that satisfy two conditions. Using **data from the Billboard Music Charts**, the following query will return all rows for top-10 recordings in 2012.

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM tutorial.billboard_top_100_year_end
 WHERE year = 2012 AND year_rank <= 10
```

You can use SQL's `AND` operator with additional `AND` statements or any other comparison operator, as many times as you want. If you run this query, you'll notice that all of the requirements are satisfied.

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM tutorial.billboard_top_100_year_end
 WHERE year = 2012
   AND year_rank <= 10
   AND group_name ILIKE '%feat%'
```

You can see that this example is spaced out onto multiple lines â€” a good way to make long `WHERE` clauses more readable.

### Practice Problems

1. Write a query that surfaces all rows for top-10 hits for which Ludacris is part of the Group.

#### Solution

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM tutorial.billboard_top_100_year_end
 WHERE year_rank <= 10
   AND group_name ILIKE '%Ludacris%'
```

2. Write a query that surfaces the top-ranked records in 1990, 2000, and 2010.

#### Solution

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM tutorial.billboard_top_100_year_end
 WHERE year_rank = 1
   AND year IN (1990, 2000, 2010)
```

3. Write a query that lists all songs from the 1960s with "love" in the title.

#### Solution

```sql
SELECT * 
  FROM tutorial.billboard_top_100_year_end
WHERE song_name ILIKE '%love%'
AND year BETWEEN 1960 AND 1969
```
