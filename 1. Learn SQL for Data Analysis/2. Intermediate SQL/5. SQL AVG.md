### The SQL AVG function

`AVG` is a **SQL aggregate function** that calculates the average of a selected group of values. It's very useful, but has some limitations. First, it can only be used on numerical columns. Second, it ignores nulls completely. You can see this by comparing these two queries of the **Apple stock prices dataset:**

```sql
SELECT AVG(high)
  FROM tutorial.aapl_historical_stock_price
 WHERE high IS NOT NULL
```

The above query produces the same result as the following query:

```sql
SELECT AVG(high)
  FROM tutorial.aapl_historical_stock_price
```

There are some cases in which you'll want to treat null values as 0. For these cases, you'll want to write a statement that changes the nulls to 0.
