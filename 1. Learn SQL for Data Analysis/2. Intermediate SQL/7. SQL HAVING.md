## SQL HAVING

**In this lesson I'll cover:**
- The SQL HAVING clause
- Query clause order

### The SQL HAVING clause

In **the previous lesson**, you learned how to use the `GROUP BY` clause to aggregate stats from the **Apple stock prices dataset** by month and year.

However, you'll often encounter datasets where `GROUP BY` isn't enough to get what you're looking for. Let's say that it's not enough just to know aggregated stats by month. After all, there are a lot of months in this dataset. Instead, you might want to find every month during which AAPL stock worked its way over $400/share. The `WHERE` clause won't work for this because it doesn't allow you to filter on aggregate columnsâ€”that's where the `HAVING` clause comes in:

```sql
SELECT year,
       month,
       MAX(high) AS month_high
  FROM tutorial.aapl_historical_stock_price
 GROUP BY year, month
HAVING MAX(high) > 400
 ORDER BY year, month
 ```

 _Note: `HAVING` is the "clean" way to filter a query that has been aggregated, but this is also commonly done using a subquery._

### Query clause order

As mentioned in prior lessons, the order in which you write the clauses is important. Here's the order for everything you've learned so far:

1. SELECT
2. FROM
3. WHERE
4. GROUP BY
5. HAVING
6. ORDER BY
