## SQL MIN/MAX

**In this lesson we'll cover:**
- The SQL MIN and MAX functions
- Practice problems

### The SQL MIN and MAX functions

`MIN` and `MAX` are **SQL aggregation functions** that return the lowest and highest values in a particular column.

They're similar to `COUNT` in that they can be used on non-numerical columns. Depending on the column type, `MIN` will return the lowest number, earliest date, or non-numerical value as close alphabetically to "A" as possible. As you might suspect, `MAX` does the oppositeâ€”it returns the highest number, the latest date, or the non-numerical value closest alphabetically to "Z."

For example, the following query selects the `MIN` and the `MAX` from the numerical `volume` column in the **Apple stock prices dataset.**

```sql
SELECT MIN(volume) AS min_volume,
       MAX(volume) AS max_volume
  FROM tutorial.aapl_historical_stock_price
```
