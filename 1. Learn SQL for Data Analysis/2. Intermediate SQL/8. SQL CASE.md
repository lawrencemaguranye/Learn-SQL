For the next few lessons, you'll work with data on College Football Players. This data was collected from ESPN on January 15, 2014 from the rosters listed on [this page](https://www.espn.com/college-football/teams) using a Python scraper [available here](https://github.com/mode/blog/blob/master/2014-01-16-football-hometowns/espn_cfb_scraper.py). In this particular lesson, you'll stick to roster information. This table is pretty self-explanatory—one row per player, with columns that describe attributes for that player. Run this query to check out the raw data:

```sql
SELECT * FROM benn.college_football_players
```

### The SQL CASE statement

The `CASE` statement is SQL's way of handling if/then logic. The `CASE` statement is followed by at least one pair of `WHEN` and `THEN` statements—SQL's equivalent of IF/THEN in Excel. Because of this pairing, you might be tempted to call this SQL `CASE WHEN`, but `CASE` is the accepted term.

Every `CASE` statement must end with the `END` statement. The `ELSE` statement is optional, and provides a way to capture values not specified in the `WHEN/THEN` statements. `CASE` is easiest to understand in the context of an example:

```sql
SELECT player_name,
       year,
       CASE WHEN year = 'SR' THEN 'yes'
            ELSE NULL END AS is_a_senior
  FROM benn.college_football_players
```

In plain English, here's what's happening:

1. The `CASE` statement checks each row to see if the conditional statement — `year = 'SR'` is true.
2. For any given row, if that conditional statement is true, the word "yes" gets printed in the column that we have named `is_a_senior`.
3. In any row for which the conditional statement is false, nothing happens in that row, leaving a null value in the `is_a_senior` column.
4. At the same time all this is happening, SQL is retrieving and displaying all the values in the `player_name` and `year` columns.

The above query makes it pretty easy to see what's happening because we've included the `CASE` statement along with the `year` column itself. You can check each row to see whether `year` meets the condition `year = 'SR'` and then see the result in the column generated using the CASE statement.

But what if you don't want null values in the `is_a_senior` column? The following query replaces those nulls with "no":

```sql
SELECT player_name,
       year,
       CASE WHEN year = 'SR' THEN 'yes'
            ELSE 'no' END AS is_a_senior
  FROM benn.college_football_players
```

### Adding multiple conditions to CASE statement

You can also define a number of outcomes in a `CASE` statement by including as many `WHEN` / `THEN` statements as you'd like:

```sql
SELECT player_name,
       weight,
       CASE WHEN weight > 250 THEN 'over 250'
            WHEN weight > 200 THEN '201-250'
            WHEN weight > 175 THEN '176-200'
            ELSE '175 or under' END AS weight_group
  FROM benn.college_football_players
```

In the above example, the `WHEN` / `THEN` statements will get evaluated in the order that they're written. So if the value in the `weight` column of a given row is 300, it will produce a result of "over 250". Here's what happens if the value in the `weight` column is 180, SQL will do the following:

1. Check to see if `weight` is greater than 250. 180 is not greater than 250, so move on to the next `WHEN` / `THEN`
2. Check to see if `weight` is greater than 200. 180 is not greater than 200, so move on to the next `WHEN` / `THEN`
3. Check to see if `weight` is greater than 175. 180 is greater than 175, so record "175-200" in the `weight_group` column.

While the above works, it's really best practice to create statements that don't overlap. `WHEN weight > 250` and `WHEN weight > 200` overlap for every value greater than 250, which is a little confusing. A better way to write the above would be:

```sql
SELECT player_name,
       weight,
       CASE WHEN weight > 250 THEN 'over 250'
            WHEN weight > 200 AND weight <= 250 THEN '201-250'
            WHEN weight > 175 AND weight <= 200 THEN '176-200'
            ELSE '175 or under' END AS weight_group
  FROM benn.college_football_players
```

You can also string together multiple conditional statements with `AND` and `OR` the same way you might in a `WHERE` clause:

```sql
SELECT player_name,
       CASE WHEN year = 'FR' AND position = 'WR' THEN 'frosh_wr'
            ELSE NULL END AS sample_case_statement
  FROM benn.college_football_players
```

### A quick review of CASE basics:

1. The `CASE` statement always goes in the SELECT clause
2. `CASE` must include the following components: `WHEN`, `THEN`, and `END` . `ELSE` is an optional component.
3. You can make any conditional statement using any conditional operator (like `WHERE`) between `WHEN` and `THEN`. This includes stringing together multiple conditional statements using `AND` and `OR`. 
4. You can include multiple `WHEN` statements, as well as an `ELSE` statement to deal with any unaddressed conditions.

### Using CASE with aggregate functions

`CASE`'s slightly more complicated and substantially more useful functionality comees from pairing it with aggregate functions. For example, let's say you want to only count rows that fulfill a certain condition. Since `COUNT` ignores nulls, you could use a `CASE` statement to evaluate the condition and produce null or non-null values depending on the outcome:

```sql
SELECT CASE WHEN year = 'FR' THEN 'FR'
            ELSE 'Not FR' END AS year_group,
            COUNT(1) AS count
  FROM benn.college_football_players
 GROUP BY CASE WHEN year = 'FR' THEN 'FR'
               ELSE 'Not FR' END
```

Now, you might be thinking "why wouldn't I just use a `WHERE` clause to filter out the rows I don't want to count?" You could do that - it would look like this:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(1) AS fr_count
  FROM benn.college_football_players
 WHERE year = 'FR'
```

But what if you also want to count a couple other conditions? Using the `WHERE` clause only allows you to count one condition. Here's an example of counting multiple conditions in one query:

```sql
SELECT CASE WHEN year = 'FR' THEN 'FR'
            WHEN year = 'SO' THEN 'SO'
            WHEN year = 'JR' THEN 'JR'
            WHEN year = 'SR' THEN 'SR'
            ELSE 'No Year Data' END AS year_group,
            COUNT(1) AS count
  FROM benn.college_football_players
 GROUP BY 1
```

The above query is an excellent place to use numbers instead of columns in the `GROUP BY` clause because repeating the `CASE` statement in the `GROUP BY` clause would make the query obnoxiously long. Alternatively, you can use the column's alias in the `GROUP BY` clause like this:

```sql
SELECT CASE WHEN year = 'FR' THEN 'FR'
            WHEN year = 'SO' THEN 'SO'
            WHEN year = 'JR' THEN 'JR'
            WHEN year = 'SR' THEN 'SR'
            ELSE 'No Year Data' END AS year_group,
            COUNT(1) AS count
  FROM benn.college_football_players
 GROUP BY year_group
```

Note that if you do choose to repeat the entire `CASE` statement, you should remove the `AS year_group` column naming when you copy/paste into the `GROUP BY` clause:

```sql
SELECT CASE WHEN year = 'FR' THEN 'FR'
            WHEN year = 'SO' THEN 'SO'
            WHEN year = 'JR' THEN 'JR'
            WHEN year = 'SR' THEN 'SR'
            ELSE 'No Year Data' END AS year_group,
            COUNT(1) AS count
  FROM benn.college_football_players
 GROUP BY CASE WHEN year = 'FR' THEN 'FR'
               WHEN year = 'SO' THEN 'SO'
               WHEN year = 'JR' THEN 'JR'
               WHEN year = 'SR' THEN 'SR'
               ELSE 'No Year Data' END
```

Combining `CASE` statements with aggregations can be tricky at first. It's often helpful to write a query containing the `CASE` statement first and run it on its own. Using the previous example, you might first write:

```sql
SELECT CASE WHEN year = 'FR' THEN 'FR'
            WHEN year = 'SO' THEN 'SO'
            WHEN year = 'JR' THEN 'JR'
            WHEN year = 'SR' THEN 'SR'
            ELSE 'No Year Data' END AS year_group,
            *
  FROM benn.college_football_players
```

The above query will show all columns in the `benn.college_football_players` table, as well as a column showing the results of the `CASE` statement. From there, you can replace the `*` with aggregation and add a `GROUP BY` clause.

### 1. Practice Problem
Write a query that counts the number of 300lb+ players for each of the following regions: West Coast (CA, OR, WA), Texas, and Other (everywhere else).

#### Solution

```sql
SELECT CASE WHEN state IN ('CA', 'OR', 'WA') THEN 'West Coast'
            WHEN state = 'TX' THEN 'Texas'
            ELSE 'Other' END AS arbitrary_regional_designation,
            COUNT(1) AS players
  FROM benn.college_football_players
 WHERE weight >= 300
 GROUP BY 1
```

### 2. Practice Problem
Write a query that calculates the combined weight of all underclass players (FR/SO) in California as well as the combined weight of all upperclass players (JR/SR) in California.

#### Solution 

```sql
SELECT CASE WHEN year IN ('FR', 'SO') THEN 'underclass'
            WHEN year IN ('JR', 'SR') THEN 'upperclass'
            ELSE NULL END AS class_group,
       SUM(weight) AS combined_player_weight
  FROM benn.college_football_players
 WHERE state = 'CA'
 GROUP BY 1
```

### Using CASE inside of aggregate functions

In the previous examples, data was displayed vertically, but in some instances, you might want to show data horizontally. This is known as "pivoting" (like a pivot table in Excel). Let's take the following query:

```sql
SELECT CASE WHEN year = 'FR' THEN 'FR'
            WHEN year = 'SO' THEN 'SO'
            WHEN year = 'JR' THEN 'JR'
            WHEN year = 'SR' THEN 'SR'
            ELSE 'No Year Data' END AS year_group,
            COUNT(1) AS count
  FROM benn.college_football_players
 GROUP BY 1
```

And re-orient it horizontally:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(CASE WHEN year = 'FR' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS fr_count,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN year = 'SO' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS so_count,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN year = 'JR' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS jr_count,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN year = 'SR' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS sr_count
  FROM benn.college_football_players
```

It's worth noting that going from horizontal to vertical orientation can be a substantially more difficult problem depending on the circumstances, and is covered in greater depth in a later lesson.
