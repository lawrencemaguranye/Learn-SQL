## SQL SUM

**In this lesson we'll cover:**
- The SQL SUM function
- Practice problem

### The SQL SUM function

`SUM` is a **SQL aggregate function**. that totals the values in a given column. Unlike COUNT, you can only use `SUM` on columns containing numerical values.

The query below selects the sum of the `volume` column from the **Apple stock prices dataset:**

```sql
SELECT SUM(volume)
  FROM tutorial.aapl_historical_stock_price
```

An important thing to remember: **aggregators only aggregate vertically**. If you want to perform a calculation across rows, you would do this with **simple arithmetic**.

You don't need to worry as much about the presence of nulls with `SUM` as you would with `COUNT`, as `SUM` treats nulls as 0.
