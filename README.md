# 👩🏻‍💻 Learn SQL

Hi, welcome to my SQL repo! 🙋🏻‍♀️

During my learning process, I've taken multiple courses from several online SQL resources where I got to learn and practice SQL questions. 

Then I thought, why not compile my solutions in a repository where I can refer to and study, so this is why I created this repository! 

Also, do take note that different courses/websites may use different SQL 'Database Management Systems' such as:
- PostgreSQL (most common!)
- Microsoft SQL Server (more commonly known as "SQL Server" or "MS SQL Server" and also my personal favourite)
- MySQL
- SQLite and more
